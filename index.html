  <p>
    I was born in Ivano-Frankivsk - a beutiful town in the west of Ukraine.
    I enjoyed art from an early age.

  <p>
    I hold Masters in Petroleum Engineering and a PhD in Computational Physics specializing in stochastic inversion.
    For the last 15 years I have worked as a Reservoir Engineer and am now pursuing my passion in Art and Analytics.
